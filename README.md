# MachineIntelligence-NaiveBayes-Blazor

Implementation of the Naive Bayes Classifier in C# inside Blazor WebAssembly (runs 100% on the web browser similar to Silverlight or Flash) with NO PLUGINS required.

Project will have two demos:
1) Port (mostly line by line) of the implementation from the MSDN article from James McCaffrey:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2013/february/test-run-naive-bayes-classification-with-csharp
2) Custom implementation using baseball data for Hall of Fame Classification (pending implementation)
